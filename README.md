# Extra_Credit (RSA Encryption)

This code is a work in progress and is not close to the intended/desired outcome

This project was 1/3 extra credit assignments for CSE 310 Discrete Structures to get us to apply the use of some mathematics for a better understanding.
- Some of the comcepts include Euclidean Algorithm and Trials Division

In this assignment, we were to create an RSA Encryption Algorithm in a language of our choosing
- This code uses c++ and two separate files, one fore the main file and the other for all of the functions
- The utilization of vectors in this project is heavy

Future:
1. Readability:
  - Possibly add a new file to separate functions
  - remove uneccessary comments and add/correct existing ones for more clarity

2. Function:
   - Make sure the outputs reflect the correct intent (cipher code or deciphered code) based on user input
   - Perhaps correct the underlying use of methods and replace it with a template style design
   - Perhaps add the ability to allow the user to add multiple items/strings to decrypt and create an output file
      - Could use some type of ADT to hold the list of ciphered texts.
